# Talltale

Talltale is a Clojure library that generates fake data, useful for prototyping and performs things like load testing used with clojure.spec for instance.

Talltale provides traditional Clojure's functions that generates values but also test.check/clojure.spec generators (with -gen suffix). 

I was inspired by the [JFairy lib](https://github.com/Codearte/jfairy) (I actually copied the nice data used by their generators).

## Installation

Declare the lib dependency in Leiningen:

```clojure
[talltale "0.1.0"]
```

## Usage

Require the core namespace, every generators is merged into the core namespace for convenience.

```clojure
(use '[talltale.core])

(company :fr) 
;; => {:address {:city "Le Perreux-sur-Marne", :postal-code "10000",
;;            :street "Grande Rue", :street-number 1},
;;  :domain "buapel.com", :email "ventes@buapel.com", :full-name "Buapel Ltd",
;;  :identification-number "00000001",
;;  :logo-url "http://via.placeholder.com/350x150?text=Buapel", :name "Buapel",
;;  :org-id "BUAPEL", :phone-number "0100000000", :tld "com", :type "Ltd",
;;  :url "https://www.buapel.com"}

(company);; default is always :en locale 
;; => {:address {:city "Miami", :postal-code "10076", :street "Ford Street",
;;            :street-number 233},
;;  :domain "adapt.com", :email "contact@adapt.com",
;;  :full-name "Adapt Associates", :identification-number "12-0000016",
;;  :logo-url "http://via.placeholder.com/350x150?text=Adapt", :name "Adapt",
;;  :org-id "ADAPT", :phone-number "124-124-0124", :tld "com",
;;  :type "Associates", :url "https://www.adapt.com"}

(person)
;; => {:address {:city "San Francisco", :postal-code "10000",
;;            :street "Summer Place", :street-number 1},
;;  :age 37,
;;  :date-of-birth #object[org.joda.time.LocalDate 0x7d24c344 "1981-01-08"],
;;  :email "shannon@yahoo.com", :first-name "Khloe", :last-name "Shannon",
;;  :phone-number "122-122-122",
;;  :picture-url "https://randomuser.me/api/portraits/women/4.jpg", :sex :female,
;;  :username "khloe"}

;;you got the test.check generator version
(gen/sample (person-gen))

(address)
(address-gen)
(phone-number);;=> "124-124-0124"
(company)
(company-gen)
(lorem-ipsum)
(text)

```

Notes: I use test.check generators for numbers, so don't be surprised by the value as they respect the ["Growth and Shrink" manner of test.check](https://github.com/clojure/test.check/blob/master/doc/growth-and-shrinking.md).
